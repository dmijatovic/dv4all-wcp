# Loaders/Spinners as web components

This lib contains some loaders/spinners I used in the past as web components. These loaders are 'stolen' from web over the course of time.
The only added value of this library is that these are created as plain web components and can be used in on any web page.

## Usage

```
const loaders = require('loaders');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
