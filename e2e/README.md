# Testing with Cypress

This folder contains Cypress setup to test web components.

My attepts to test web components with Jest were not succefull. Maybe it is my lack of knowledge of Jest. I did found [demo for testing web components with Cypress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsF6jer8Mxk).

At this point in time is seems easier to test web components on the demo projects with Cypress. In addition these test do cover both the components modules and the demo 'sites'.

## Installing cypress is easy

I added Cypress as dependecy at the root project.
